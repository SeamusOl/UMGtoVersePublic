# UMGtoVersePublic
**Welcome to my UMG to Verse Converter!** ;NBSP
*Made by: @MooseInDaCut*

This is still a beta version of the program, please report any bugs or issues by either dm'ing
me on Twitter @mooseindacut or on Discord @mooseindacut

To use this tool simply run the .exe and wait for the website to open.
This tool hosts a local flask server so make sure to keep the terminal open.

To convert your UMG to Verse you need to right click the parent widget in your UMG blueprint
and copy it. Then in the tool paste the text into the given text box and click convert.

By default all color/texture blocks, text blocks, and buttons are made into variables at the 
top of your UI class, to change any of these from variables to be hardcoded click the get 
widgets button on the right. This will give a list of all the color/texture blocks, text blocks,
and buttons your UI uses, if you would like to use it as a variable check the box, if you want
if hard coded leave the box unchecked.

Once your UI has been converted you can click "copy to clipboard" and the text should be copied,
if the copying does not work click "copy to clipboard" to select everything and then manually
press Ctrl+C to copy. 

If you have any questions or concerns reach out to me on Twitter or Discord @mooseindacut

Enjoy!!!
